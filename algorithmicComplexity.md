Let's analyze the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of the given `createPalindrome` algorithm.

### **Time Complexity:**

Time complexity refers to how the runtime of the algorithm grows with respect to the input size, in this case, the length of `originalWord`.

In this algorithm, there are two main steps:

1. **String Concatenation in the Loop:**  
   - The loop starts from `originalWord.length - 2` and goes to 0 (i.e., it iterates over each character of the string except for the last one). 
   - For each iteration, the algorithm performs string concatenation (`definitiveWord += originalWord[i]`).
   
   The loop runs for `n-1` iterations, where `n` is the length of the string `originalWord` (the loop runs from index `n-2` to index `0`).

- The **loop** starts with `i = originalWord.length - 2`. This means that the loop starts at the second-to-last character of the string (because `originalWord.length - 1` is the index of the last character).
- The **loop condition** is `i >= 0`, which means the loop will continue running as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. So, the loop stops when `i` reaches 0.
- **The loop decreases `i` by 1** in each iteration (`i--`), so it moves backwards through the string.

For example, if `originalWord` has a length of 4, the indices of the string are:
- `originalWord[0]` (first character)
- `originalWord[1]` (second character)
- `originalWord[2]` (third character)
- `originalWord[3]` (fourth character)

If the length of the string is 4 (`n = 4`), the loop starts at `originalWord.length - 2`, which is `4 - 2 = 2`. So, `i` starts at index 2 and goes down to index 0, iterating over `originalWord[2]`, `originalWord[1]`, and `originalWord[0]` (in reverse order).

### So, the loop iterates for **n - 1** times:
- If `n = 4`, it runs for 3 iterations: starting at index 2, going to index 1, and finally index 0.
   
2. **String Concatenation in JavaScript:**  
   - String concatenation in JavaScript can be expensive because strings are **immutable**. Each time you concatenate a string, a new string object is created and the old string is copied into it, along with the new character.
   - In each iteration, we are appending one character to the `definitiveWord` string, which takes O(k) time where k is the length of the resulting string at that point.
   - This leads to an overall time complexity of **O(n²)** due to the repeated string concatenation.

Therefore, **the time complexity is O(n²)**, where `n` is the length of `originalWord`.

### **Space Complexity:**

Space complexity refers to the amount of memory the algorithm requires as a function of the input size.

1. **Input and Output Variables:**
   - The `originalWord` is an input string and does not contribute to additional space complexity, as we are not modifying it (we are just accessing it).
   - The `definitiveWord` is a string that grows over time as characters are appended to it.
   
2. **Memory Usage:**
   - The variable `definitiveWord` eventually holds a string that is twice the length of the input string (since it includes the original string and the reversed part).
   - In terms of space, the algorithm uses **O(n)** additional space for the `definitiveWord` string, where `n` is the length of `originalWord`.

Thus, **the space complexity is O(n)**, where `n` is the length of `originalWord`.

### **Understanding Space Complexity**

Space complexity measures how much extra memory (space) an algorithm requires relative to the input size as it runs. 

### **How the Space Complexity Works in Your Code**

In your code, the main factor contributing to space complexity is the storage used for the **`definitiveWord`** string.

#### Initial Setup:
- You start with the string `originalWord`, which takes up memory proportional to its length (let's call this `n`).
- The **`definitiveWord`** string starts as a copy of `originalWord`. So initially, `definitiveWord` occupies memory equivalent to the size of `originalWord`, i.e., O(n).

#### String Growth in the Loop:
- During the loop, you are **concatenating characters** to `definitiveWord`.
- After each iteration, `definitiveWord` grows by one character, and at the end of the loop, it will have the same length as `originalWord` plus the characters added from the reverse of `originalWord`.

So, after the loop finishes, `definitiveWord` will be twice the length of `originalWord`.

- If `originalWord` has length `n`, then `definitiveWord` will have length `2n`.

### **Space Complexity Calculation**:
- You need space to store the **originalWord** (`O(n)`).
- You also need space to store the **definitiveWord** string, which grows to twice the size of `originalWord` (`O(2n)`).

However, in Big-O notation, we drop constants and focus on the dominant term. Thus, **O(2n)** simplifies to **O(n)**.

### **Conclusion:**

The space complexity is **O(n)** because the algorithm uses extra space for the string `definitiveWord`, which can be up to twice the size of `originalWord`, but we consider the space required to be proportional to the size of the input (in this case, `n`).

Let me know if that explanation clears things up!

### **Summary:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²), due to string concatenation in each iteration of the loop.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), since the `definitiveWord` string grows to twice the length of `originalWord`.

Let's analyze the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of the given `createOptimizedPalindrome` algorithm.

### **Algorithmic Complexity Analysis of `createOptimizedPalindrome`**  

#### **1. Loop Analysis**  
```javascript
for (let i = originalWord.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) { 
    chars.push(originalWord[i]); 
}
```
- This loop runs for `originalWord.length - 1` iterations.  
- If the word length is `n`, the loop has a complexity of **O(n)**.  

#### **2. Using `join('')`**  
```javascript
return chars.join('');
```
- `join('')` concatenates all elements of the array into a single string.  
- The final concatenation of an array of size `2n - 1` has a cost of **O(n)**.  

#### **3. Total Complexity**  
- The loop is **O(n)**.  
- The `join('')` operation is **O(n)**.  
- Adding both steps, the total complexity is **O(n) + O(n) = O(n)**.  

#### **Conclusion**  
The function `createOptimizedPalindrome` has a **time complexity of O(n)**, which is efficient for this problem since it avoids repeated string concatenations (which would be **O(n²)** in the worst case).
